\description{
(i) Creates "bayts" time series data frame from multiple input time series and calculates time series of normalised conditional non-forest probabilities (PNF).
(ii) Iterative Bayesian updating of the conditional probability of change (PChange) based on PNF and detection of change
}
\details{
Short method description: First, the conditional probability for non-forest (PNF) is estimated for each individual time series observation, using the corresponding sensor specific probability density functions (pdfs) for forest (F) and non-forest (NF).
In case of multiple observation at the same date, PNF is interatively updated using Bayesian probability updating (\code{\link{calcPosterior}}).
Observations at time t (current observation) are flagged to be potentially changed in the case that the conditional NF probability (PNF) is larger than 0.5.
For a flagged observation, the conditional probability of change (PChange) is computed by iterative Bayesian updating (\code{\link{calcPosterior}}), using the previous observation (t âˆ’ 1),
the current observation (t), as well as i upcoming observations (t + i) to confirm or reject a change event at t. A change is confirmed in case PChange exceeds a given threshold "chi".
